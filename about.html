    <!--Earthy Orbiters information-->
    <h2> What's Earthy Orbiters? </h2>
    <p>Earthy Orbiters is my small business that I run with my friend! It has a bit of a story behind it as well! It is
        about two aliens who were sent to earth to learn about its culture, in doing so, they have invaded the artist
        market to blend in! The aliens are named RUA and Sky based on my and my friend's nicknames! They also have a
        boss who’s our mascot named Ooo and Eye. We sell anime and video game fan merch! Like keychains, prints,
        stickers and temporary tattoos! My personal favorite product that we sell is my Overwatch keychain series!</p>
